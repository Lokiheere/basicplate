// window and handle events. It initializes different logging mechanisms depending
// on the target architecture, creates an event loop and a window, initializes the
// state of the application with the created window, and starts the event loop which
//listens for various window events and handles redrawing the window when necessary.
//If the target architecture is wasm32 (WebAssembly), the size of the window is set
//manually, and the windowâ€™s canvas is appended to a specific element in the HTML document.
//The event loop listens for various window events such as closing the window, resizing the window,
//or changing the scale factor. It also handles redrawing the window when necessary.
//The run function is marked to be the start function when the target architecture is wasm32.
